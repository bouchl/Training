On Day 1 of Induction Week you’ll receive an email on your Connect Portal with your login details to Salesforce Connect.
Log into Salesforce Connect, then from the Home Menu, once your Learning Profile has been successfully activated, you will see the “My Training” button in the lower right of the screen.
Click upon “My Training”.
The system will automatically log you into the training platform (LMS) within the browser window.
Follow the guide to access your training plan and register for your curriculum.
If at any time you are unable to access the Training Platform, or experience any difficulties, please email the helpdesk team on: onshelpdesk@adecco.co.uk
